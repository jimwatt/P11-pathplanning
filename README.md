# Path Planning

This project is in conjunction with the Udacity Self-Driving Car course.  In particular, the goal of this project is to implement a path planning algorithm that allows an autonomous vehicle to safely navigate highway traffic in a simulator.

* More detail about the approach is provided in [writeup.md](./writeup.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
CMake
uWS		(Socket for interfacing with Udacity simulator)	
```

### Installing

1. Clone this project from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/jimwatt/P11-pathplanning.git
```

2. Change into the `build` directory, and compile with `CMake`.

   ```
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Running the Code

* Run the executable from the `build` directory:
  ```./path_planning```
* The executable will wait until sensor fusion telemetry data are provided by the simulator through the uWS socket.
